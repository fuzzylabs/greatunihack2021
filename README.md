We want you to make something cool with reinforcement learning!

Your project will be assessed based on the creativity of the solution / task that the model(s) performs. If you need to (or want to!) use something complex like state-of-the-art Deep RL neural nets, go for it! But we know simple AI solutions can solve facinating problems just as well!

## Places to start

Try these for an introduction to RL: [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-reinforcement-learning/), [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-e24b50e1d292)

OpenAI gym provides a bunch of [test environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) for playing around with RL.
This [PyTorch Deep Q Learning tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) may be a good starting point for model training.

You can even make your [own environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-custom-openai-gym-environment-for-stock-trading-be532be3910e) using the OpenAI library! Here's an interesting snippet from the article:
```python
import gym
from gym import spaces

class CustomEnv(gym.Env):
  """Custom Environment that follows gym interface"""
  metadata = {'render.modes': ['human']}

  def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ...):
    super(CustomEnv, self).__init__()
    # Define action and observation space
    # They must be gym.spaces objects
    # Example when using discrete actions:
    self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(N_DISCRETE_ACTIONS)
    # Example for using image as input:
    self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=255, shape=
                    (HEIGHT, WIDTH, N_CHANNELS), dtype=np.uint8)

  def step(self, action):
    # Execute one time step within the environment
    ...
  def reset(self):
    # Reset the state of the environment to an initial state
    ...
  def render(self, mode='human', close=False):
    # Render the environment to the screen
    ...
```

Feel free to a look at other Reinforcement Learning libraries (it doesn't have to be Python), there are plenty out there.

* Want to pit your bot against itself or play against your bot? Try [Simple](https://github.com/davidADSP/SIMPLE). The creator has written a great [article](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-train-ai-agents-to-play-multiplayer-games-using-self-play-deep-reinforcement-learning-247d0b440717) about it!
* Want to use real hardware agents? Check out [this hack](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/25/little-lamp-to-learn-longer-leaps/) by Roger Cheng.
* Want to be REALLY ambitious try using human preference to evaluate your AI like [this](https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/). (P.S: This would be really hard)
